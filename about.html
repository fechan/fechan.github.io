    <p>When you hire me, you know you're getting a dependable developer who researches and understands the best practices for <em>your</em> codebase. I'm passionate about writing beautiful code that other developers love to work with, and well-engineered software users will love to use.</p>

      <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-3">I write readable, maintainable software</h2>
      <p>Software development is a team effort. That's why when I write software, I always ask myselfâ€• <i>what would it be like for another dev to see my code for the first time?</i><span class="inline-block w-1" data-comment="HACK: this span is to fix the kerning between the italic question mark and the next sentence."></span> When you hire me, you know you're getting code that's built to last, because I prioritize readability and maintainability over clever hacks and one-liners. I follow <em>your</em> organization's code style, research the best practices before I start writing, and vigilantly document my code.</p>

      <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-3">I'm experienced and flexible</h2>
      <p>In both industry and research, I've written software for a diverse range of domains. Whether it's developing <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/news/2023/06/students-showcase-skills-and-solutions-annual-capstone-gala-event">award-winning web apps</a> that help friends make dining decisions or writing machine learning code for <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.add2187">cutting-edge protein research</a> published in <i>Science</i>, I've proven time and time again that I'm flexible and can work with any tech stack you need. Not only do I integrate well with any existing codebase, I've also created and architected many projects from scratch as well.</p>

      <p>Since I've been programming since my freshman year of high school, I've made a wide variety of <a href="https://fredchan.org/#projects">personal projects</a>. One of my favorites is a <a href="https://grow.fredchan.org/">multiplayer web implementation</a> of my own board game, <a href="https://fredchan.org/blog/how-to-play-grow/">Grow</a>. I'm also the Club President of the <a href="https://conlang.club/">Seattle Conlang Club</a> since 2022, and created the website for members to get information about upcoming meetings and events. Writing software for myself and for others has brought me great joy in my life, so I hope to be writing software for you too!</p>
