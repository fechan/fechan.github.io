## Topicalization
Adiugoskr is a topic-prominent language that allows the discourse topic to be set by putting the topicalized NP at the start (or in some cases, end) of the sentence. If the head noun of the NP is inanimate, then the noun's final syllable will have a rising tone.

The topicalized NP does not necessarily need to be an argument of a verb in the sentence; it may simply be relevant in the discourse context.

## Morphosyntactic alignment
Adiugoskr is a direct-inverse language that organizes verbal arguments according to a hierarchy. The argument that is higher on this hierarchy is the agent of the verb, and the argument that is lower on this hierarchy is the object. This hierarchy is based on an NP's salience to the discourse context, and 1st and 2nd person arguments (also called *Speech Act Participants*, or *SAPs*) are generally more salient than animate 3rd person arguments, which are more generally more salient than inanimate 3rd person arguments.

Arguments can be made more salient (*promoted*) by marking an overt noun argument with the proximate marker **-d√©**, or by topicalizing them. While an SAP that has been promoted outranks other SAPs, a promoted 3rd person argument can never outrank any SAP. Thus, the full hierarchy is as follows:

1. Speech Act Participants (SAPs)
    1. Proximate SAPs
    2. Topicalized SAPs
    3. 1st person arguments
    4. 2nd person arguments
2. 3rd person arguments
    1. Proximate 3rd person arguments
    2. Topicalized 3rd person arguments
    3. Animate 3rd person arguments
    4. Inanimate 3rd person arguments

### Inverted verbs
A rising tone on the final syllable of a verb indicates that it has been inverted, and that the higher-ranking argument is the object and the lower-raking argument is the agent.

### Inherently inverse verbs
Some verbs are inherently inverse, meaning that for those verbs, animate and promoted 3rd person arguments are outrank SAPs, which in turn outrank non-promoted inanimate arguments. Thus, the following hierarchy applies for inherently inverse verbs:

2. 3rd person arguments
    1. Proximate 3rd person arguments
    2. Topicalized 3rd person arguments
    3. Animate 3rd person arguments
1. Speech Act Participants (SAPs)
    1. Proximate SAPs
    2. Topicalized SAPs
    3. 1st person arguments
    4. 2nd person arguments
3. Non-promoted inanimate 3rd person arguments

Most inherently inverse verbs are verbs that are unpleasant or immoral for a person to do, such as [**rrigau** *'murder'*](/adiugoskr/dictionary#murder) or [**vemba** *'swindle'*](/adiugoskr/dictionary#swindle).
