Adiugoskr complementizers appear at the start of complementizer phrases, such as main and subordinate clauses. A complementizer is required at the head of subordinate clauses, but not main clauses. There are multiple types of complementizers that mark polarity, questions, and evidentiality, which may occur in sequence (also known as *complementizer stacking*).

## Positive and negative complementizers
The default polarity of clauses is positive, but the positive complementizer is only required in subordinate clauses that are headed by no other complementizers.

* **vi**: positive polarity
* **sa**: negative polarity

## Question complementizer
The question marking complementizer is **anǎ** and is used with both yes/no questions and wh-questions.

## Evidentiality complementizers
A lack of an evidentiality complementizer leaves the evidential source ambiguous.

* **tún**: sensed
* **gel**: inferential
* **aun**: reportative
* **ajén**: gnomic

  <summary>Conlanger note: Dream interpretation</summary>

  <p>I want to do a bit more on the dream interpretation aspect of Ogdorjan culture, maybe with a separate set of evidentiality complementizers for information learned through a dream. The fact that these complementizers can appear directly next to NPs was a part of that idea, but I want to expand it into more of a system than just a couple of features thrown in the conlang.</p>
