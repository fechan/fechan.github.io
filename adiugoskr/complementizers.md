Adiugoskr [complementizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementizer) appear at the start of complementizer phrases, such as main and subordinate clauses. A complementizer is required at the head of subordinate clauses, but not main clauses. There are multiple types of complementizers that mark polarity, questions, and evidentiality, which may occur in sequence (also known as *complementizer stacking*).

## Positive and negative complementizers
The default [polarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmation_and_negation) of clauses is positive, but the positive complementizer is only required in subordinate clauses that are headed by no other complementizers.

* **vi**: Positive polarity
* **sa**: Negative polarity

## Question complementizer
The question marking complementizer is **anǎ** and is used with both yes/no questions and wh-questions.

## Evidentiality complementizers
The [evidentiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidentiality) complementizers indicate how the information conveyed in the complementizer phrase was known. A lack of an evidentiality complementizer leaves the evidential source ambiguous.

* **tún**: Sensed evidence, for information known through the speaker's own physical senses.
* **gel**: Inferential evidence, for conclusions and information inferred from something else.
* **aun**: Reportative evidence, for information received from another person, through speech, writing, or other method.
* **ajén**: Gnomic evidence, for general facts, truths and aphorisms.

### Dreamed evidentialities
If a piece of information was received during a dream or vision, a different set of evidentials are used. These are not used for dreams created from one's own imagination, such as daydreams, wishes, and aspirations.

* **áutr**: Sensed-in-dream, for information known through the speaker's own senses during a dream, or for information inferred from other dream-information.
* **wiva**: Reported-in-dream, for information received from another person in a dream, through speech, writing, or other method.
* **vén**: Believed-in-dream, for information with no apparent evidential source, but was "just known" during the dream.
