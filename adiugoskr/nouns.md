## Animacy
By default, all of the syllables in an inanimate noun are low tone, and the final syllable in animate nouns is high tone.

Underlyingly, only the final syllable is specified for tone, with low tone specified for inanimate nouns and high tone specified for animate nouns. In Adiugoskr, any syllables with unspecified tone become low tone when spoken.

## Proximate
Nouns can be marked as physically close or more salient to the discourse context with the proximate marker **-dé**. Due to tone sandhi, inanimate proximate nouns have a rising tone on the penultimate syllable.

## Topicalization
Noun phrases can be topicalized by putting them at the start or end of a sentence. If the head noun is inanimate, it will have a rising tone. See [Morphosyntax§Topicalization](/adiugoskr/morphosyntax#topicalization) for details on the syntax and semantics of topicalization.

Underlyingly, the topic marking morpheme is simply a high tone, which fuses with the low tone final syllable of inanimate nouns to form the rising tone.

## Possession
A *possessum* noun that is possessed by a *possessor* is marked using the possessum marker **-war**, glossed <small-caps>POSS</small-caps>. The marker agrees with its possessor in animacy: if the possessor is animate, the marker will be high tone **-wár**, and if it is inanimate, the marker will be low tone **-war**. Due to tone sandhi, inanimate possessums will have a rising tone on the penultimate syllable.

Like adjectives, the possessor usually follows the possessum, but both possessum-possessor and possessor-possessum orders are grammatical.
