## Introduction
Adiugoskr is an *a priori* naturalistic conlang spoken by most residents of the fictional *Kingdom of Ogdorja,* a country of people who place great importance on the interpretation of dreams and who are struggling to modernize their economy after a long period of militant isolationism.

### Goals for this conlang:
1. Be developed enough for general worldbuilding use
2. Appear plausibly naturalistic on the surface level
3. Have interesting and interconnected morphosyntactic systems
4. Integrate its vocabulary and grammar with the culture of the Ogdorjans
5. Be developed enough that translating arbitrary sentences can be done with at most minor changes to the grammar
