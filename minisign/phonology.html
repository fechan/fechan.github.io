<h2 id="sign-constituents">Sign constituents</h2>
<p class="mb-3">Each sign may be specified for one or more of the following parameters, which together make up the sign. If a sign is not specified for a certain parameter, changes in that parameter does not alter its lexical meaning (though it may have grammatical significance).</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Handshape</dt>
  <dd>Configuration of the fingers, e.g. fist, flat hand, thumbs-up, etc.</dd>

  <dt>Hand orientation</dt>
  <dd>Direction the fingers and palm are pointing. When not specified, any orientation is allowed.</dd>

  <dt>Hand constellation</dt>
  <dd>Whether the hands are near, touching, clasped, etc. Never specified in 1-handed signs. If not specified in a 2-handed sign, the hands are apart by default.</dd>

  <dt>Hand symmetry</dt>
  <dd>In 2-handed signs, whether the hands mirror each other. Never specified in 1-handed signs. If not specified in a 2-handed sign, the hands are asymmetric and their location and handshape must be specified.</dd>

  <dt>Location</dt>
  <dd>Location where the sign is articulated.</dd>

  <dt>Movement</dt>
  <dd>The sign's movement.</dd>

  <dt>Non-manuals</dt>
  <dd>Articulations that do not involve the hand. If not specified, the facial expression and body posture is neutral by default.</dd>

  <summary>Conlanger note: Choosing constituents</summary>
  <p>Since I like signs that can have all sorts of interesting configurations, and partly for convenience, I decided to include all of the ones you can notate in HamNoSys. Your conlang may not need to have all these constituents.</p>

  <p>In scholarly documentation of sign languages worldwide, all of them discuss handshape as a parameter, and nearly all (>=94.25%) discuss movement and location. Other parameters, such as palm orientation, non-manuals, and number of hands are either not discussed in a significant number (>=41.37%) of the documentation, or explicitly say that it was looked for and not found to be phonemic in the language (>=6.89%). <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1kz4f6q7" title="The Cross-linguistic Distribution of Sign Language Parameters">(Tatman 2015)</a></p>

<h2 id="handshape-inventory">Handshape inventory</h2>
<p>The following handshapes may appear on the dominant hand or the nondominant hand in signs where both hands have the same handshape.</p>

  <summary>Conlanger note: Choosing handshapes</summary>

  <p>The handshapes I chose are the common set of 22 handshapes found in four different, unrelated sign languages in <a href="https://linguistics.washington.edu/research/graduate/structure-sign-language-lexicons-inventory-and-distribution-handshape-and-location" title="The Structure of Sign Language Lexicons: Inventory and Distribution of Handshape and Location">Rozelle 2003</a>, plus a few that I wanted for certain signs such as <ham-signs>hamfinger23,hamthumbacrossmod,hammiddlefinger,hamfingernail,hamindexfinger</ham-signs> (crossed fingers) that I thought were cool. However, the sign languages analyzed in Rozelle 2003 each had from 34-49 handshapes total.</p>

  <p>Due to the iconicity of sign languages, I occasionally found myself adding more handshapes to the chart the more signs I made, which would be like adding a phoneme to your phoneme chart just because you think a word would sound cool in your spoken conlang. I don't consider this a problem though, since Rozelle 2003 found that a language's most used handshapes are used with significantly greater frequency than the rest, with an exponential dropoff in usage as you go down in rank. However, I do try to always use an existing handshape in the inventory if I feel like it wouldn't destroy the "essence" of the sign I'm making.</p>

<h2 id="location-inventory">Location inventory</h2>
<p>The following locations may appear in signs. The <ham-signs>hamlrat</ham-signs> black square indicates the left or right side of a body part; for example, <ham-signs>hamlrat,hamhead</ham-signs> indicates left of head and <ham-signs>hamhead,hamlrat</ham-signs> indicates right of head. The <ham-signs>hamlrbeside</ham-signs> white square indicates a location next to the left or right of a body part.</p>

<details class="conlanger-note">
  <summary>Conlanger note: Choosing locations</summary>

  <p>I started with the common set of 24 locations found in four different, unrelated sign languages in <a href="https://linguistics.washington.edu/research/graduate/structure-sign-language-lexicons-inventory-and-distribution-handshape-and-location" title="The Structure of Sign Language Lexicons: Inventory and Distribution of Handshape and Location">Rozelle 2003</a>. Like handshape, the usage frequency of a given location also drops exponentially with its rank. There was also a tendency for languages with larger handshape inventories to also have larger location inventories.</p>

<details class="conlanger-note">
  <summary>Conlanger note: Inventories for other parameters</summary>

  <p>I haven't found inventories of other parameters (like palm orientation or movement) for natural sign languages. For movement, it may simply be that there's just too many possibilities even in a single language to easily enumerate and, if that is the case, then it's not particularly useful to have such an inventory for a conlang either.</p>

  <p>If you're trying to make a naturalistic sign language, it might be worth it to do additional research on variations in movement and other parameters across different sign languages.</p>
