title: MiniSign word order
layout: minisign
---
* The basic word order is subject-object-verb (SOV).
* MiniSign allows for a topic-comment structure, where the topic precedes the rest of the sentence, allowing for OSV order.
* SVO is allowed, but not preferred unless the roles of the subject and object can be reversed.
  * e.g. <small-caps>ME PUSH YOU</small-caps> "I pushed you" is allowed, but #<small-caps>ME PUSH CUP</small-caps> "I pushed the cup" would be unusual because cups generally cannot push things.
* Both subjects and objects may be omitted if it has already been introduced and is [incorporated](/minisign/classifiers) into the verb, or is otherwise recoverable from context.
  * e.g. if <small-caps>CAT CUP PUSH</small-caps> "the cat pushed the cup" has been said, the sentence <small-caps>BREAK</small-caps> is valid to mean "the cup broke".
