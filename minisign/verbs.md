## Agreement and spatial verbs
Verbs can be categorized in terms of whether they agree with their subjects and objects and how they do so.

* **Agreement verbs** agree with their subjects and/or objects by changing the direction where the sign is performed.
* **Spatial verbs** agree with their subjects and/or objects by changing the location where the sign is performed.
  * ex: <span class="small-caps">[MOVE](/minisign/dictionary#move)</span>, <span class="small-caps">[SHINE](/minisign/dictionary#shine)</span>
* **Plain verbs** do not agree with their subjects or objects. However, Verbs that are produced in neutral space in MiniSign can be signed at a particular location to show where the verb takes place.
  * ex: <span class="small-caps">[MAKE](/minisign/dictionary#make)</span>

## Aspect
By default, verbs are either imperfective or perfective depending on whether or not they have a duration. Durative verbs that occur over a period of time like RUN are imperfective by default, and punctual verbs like SNEEZE that happen instantaneously are perfective by default.

### Imperfective (<span class="small-caps">IPFV</span>)
The imperfective aspect (<span class="small-caps">IPFV</span>) is marked with the auxiliary verb <span class="small-caps">[DO](/minisign/dictionary#do)</span> after the main verb.

### Perfective (<span class="small-caps">PFV</span>)
The perfective aspect (<span class="small-caps">PFV</span>) is marked with the particle sign <span class="small-caps">PFV</span> after the verb, produced the same as <span class="small-caps">[MAKE](/minisign/dictionary#make)</span> but with the nondominant hand removed.

Alternatively, the mouthing /u/ may be used during the production of the verb to mark the perfective aspect, but only for telic verbs like achievements <i>(to release)</i> or accomplishments <i>(to drown)</i>.

### Continuative (<span class="small-caps">CONT</span>)
The continuative aspect (<span class="small-caps">CONT</span>) is marked by repeating the movement of the verb.

The continuative aspect cannot be used with stative verbs.

### Habitual (<span class="small-caps">HAB</span>)
The habitual aspect (<span class="small-caps">HAB</span>) is marked with small head-nods during the production of the verb.
