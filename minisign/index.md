## Introduction
MiniSign is a signed conlang project I'm creating to learn about sign language linguistics and teach them to fellow conlangers later.

One of the main reasons there aren't many signed conlangs is the lack of signed conlangs that people can use as examples, as well as the lack of cross-linguistic resources about signed languages. This will help alleviate the former problem.

Since many conlangers take it as a challenge to create a conlang that feels plausibly naturalistic, this conlang aims to be what a signed conlang would look like in its early stages if it were trying to be naturalistic when developed in the long term. This will make it easier to learn from, and serves as a jumping off point for other conlangers to make more naturalistic signed conlangs in the future.
